GraphQL

A query language for API

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of data in API, gives clients the power to ask exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools.

Advantage of GraphQL over REST Api
- Allows Precise Data Fetching
- Rest API often leads to over fetching meaning it fetches more data than actually needed
- GraphQL uses single endpoint for all the data operations 

Three types of operations in GraphQL -> Queries (how we are going to fetch data), Mutations(How we are going to modify or write data) and subscription(real time data updates)
